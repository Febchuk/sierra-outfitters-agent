# Sierra Outfitters Agent Presentation Script (40 mins)

## 1. Introduction (5 mins)

"Thank you for the opportunity to present my Sierra Outfitters Agent implementation. Today, I'll walk you through my approach to building a customer service agent that embodies the Sierra Outfitters brand while efficiently handling customer requests.

I'll start with an overview of my architecture choices, demonstrate the key features I implemented, discuss testing and evaluation strategies, and share thoughts on prioritizing future features. Let's get started!"

## 2. Problem Understanding & Approach (7 mins)

"First, let's understand what Sierra Outfitters needed:
- A customer service agent that reflects their adventurous brand identity
- Handling order status inquiries as a core feature
- Additional customer service capabilities from a set of options
- All wrapped in their unique outdoor-focused brand voice

When approaching this problem, I considered several architectural patterns:

**Pattern matching**: Simple but limited flexibility  
**Multi-agent system**: Powerful but complex orchestration  
**Function calling approach**: Strong balance of structure and flexibility

I ultimately chose the function calling approach because:
1. It provides clear separation between intent detection and action execution
2. It's maintainable and extensible
3. It handles the natural language variations we expect from customers
4. It allows consistent application of the brand voice across all interactions"

## 3. Architecture Overview (8 mins)

"Here's how the Sierra Outfitters Agent works:

[Show the architecture diagram]

Core components:
1. **System Prompt**: Defines the brand voice and capabilities
2. **Tool Definitions**: Structured schemas for our functions
3. **Function Implementations**: Business logic for each capability 
4. **Conversation Manager**: Maintains context and history
5. **Response Generator**: Ensures consistent brand voice

The flow begins when a customer sends a message. The model interprets the intent, potentially calls a relevant function, and then generates a response that incorporates any function results while maintaining the outdoor-enthusiast brand voice.

Let me show you the key components in the code:

```python
# System prompt establishes voice and capabilities
self.system_prompt = """
    You are the customer service agent for Sierra Outfitters...
    Brand Voice Guidelines:
    - Make frequent references to the outdoors
    - Use outdoor emojis like üèîÔ∏è and more
    ...
"""

# Tools define the functions and their parameters
self.tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "check_order_status",
            "description": "Check the status of an order by email and order number.",
            "parameters": { ... }
        }
    },
    ...
]
```

For the implementation, I focused on modularity and clean separation of concerns."

## 4. Feature Demonstration (10 mins)

"Now let's see the agent in action. I've implemented three key features:

### Required Feature: Order Status and Tracking

[Show code for check_order_status function]

```python
def check_order_status(self, email: str, order_number: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Implementation details...
```

Let me demonstrate with a conversation:

User: 'Can you tell me the status of my order?'
Agent: 'I'd be happy to help you check your order status! To find your order on our trail map, I'll need your email address and order number. What's your email address? üèîÔ∏è'

User: 'john.doe@example.com'
Agent: 'Thanks for sharing your email! Now I just need your order number to complete the tracking. What's your order number? Onward into the unknown! üèîÔ∏è'

User: 'W001'
Agent: 'Great news, John! Your order #W001 has reached its destination. Your adventure gear is ready to use! You can track the final leg of its journey at https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction?tLabels=TRK123456789 if you'd like to see where it's been. The mountains are calling - time to answer with your new gear! üèîÔ∏è'

### Optional Feature 1: Early Risers Promotion

[Show code for time-based promotion]

Let me demonstrate:

[Show promotion working during valid hours]
[Show polite decline outside valid hours]

### Optional Feature 2: Product Availability

[Show code for product availability checking]

Let me demonstrate:

User: 'Do you have the Invisibility Cloak in stock?'
Agent: 'Good news, trail-seeker! I've checked our inventory and Nishita's Invisibility Cloak (SKU: SOSV007) is available with 90 items ready for your next stealth adventure! Perfect for moving undetected through the wilderness while observing wildlife. Would you like to know more about it? üèîÔ∏è'"

## 5. Code Structure & Patterns (5 mins)

"Let me highlight a few key patterns I used:

1. **Separation of concerns**: Each function is focused on one task
2. **Consistent error handling**: Graceful responses in edge cases
3. **Memory management**: Tracking conversation state
4. **Clear function contracts**: Well-defined inputs and outputs

For example, when handling partial information, the agent remembers what it's already collected:

```python
def _process_tool_calls(self, message):
    # Process tool calls and remember partial information
    ...
```

This allows natural multi-turn conversations while gathering the information needed to execute functions."

## 6. Testing & Reliability (3 mins)

"For testing this agent, I would implement:

1. **Unit tests** for each function implementation
2. **Integration tests** for the full conversation flow
3. **Regression tests** with saved conversations
4. **A/B testing** for brand voice variations

I've included logging throughout the code to capture:
- API calls
- Function executions
- User inputs
- Response generation

This gives visibility into:
- Performance bottlenecks
- Error patterns
- User satisfaction"

## 7. Success Metrics & Evaluation (3 mins)

"To measure success, I would focus on:

1. **Task completion rate**: Did customers get their questions answered?
2. **Conversation efficiency**: How many turns to resolve an issue?
3. **Customer satisfaction**: Post-interaction surveys
4. **Brand voice consistency**: Evaluation of tone and language
5. **Technical metrics**: Latency, error rates, and cost

These metrics would be tracked in a dashboard to monitor agent performance over time."

## 8. Feature Prioritization (4 mins)

"For the remaining features, here's how I would prioritize:

1. **Multilingual Support**: Highest priority, as it expands customer reach
   - Additional info needed: Language usage patterns among customers
   
2. **Product Recommendations**: Next highest, drives revenue
   - Additional info needed: Conversion metrics from recommendations
   
3. **Hiking Recommendations**: Nice enhancement but less direct business impact
   - Additional info needed: Customer interest in guidance vs. product info
   
My prioritization focuses on business impact, implementation complexity, and customer needs."

## 9. Conclusion & Next Steps (3 mins)

"To summarize:

1. The Sierra Outfitters Agent uses a function calling architecture to handle customer inquiries
2. It maintains a consistent brand voice while providing accurate information
3. It supports order tracking, early bird promotions, and product availability
4. The design is extensible for future features

Next steps would include:
- User testing with actual customers
- Expanding the product catalog integration
- Adding the prioritized features
- Setting up monitoring and continuous improvement

Thank you for your time! I'm happy to answer any questions about my implementation or approach."
